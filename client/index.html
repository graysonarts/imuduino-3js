          <h1>IMUduino examples</h1>
          <p>Here are a bunch of examples of using the IMUduino with javascript
          to give you a taste of what you can do with this device</p>
          <p>Each section below is associated with a specific sketch, either from
          the official IMUduino github, or from my sketches folder.  A link will
          be provided for each section.</p>
          <p>To use a sample, load the appropriate sketch, run 
          <strong>npm config set imuduino-3js:type [name of section]</strong>, restart the server, and then click on
          the link for the sample.</p>
          <h2>IMUduino_Bluetooth_UART_YawPitchRoll</h2>
          <p>These use the

            <dt><a href="pyr.html">Pitch-Yaw-Roll cube</a></dt>
            <dd>This is a very simple setup that allows you to control the rotation
            of a cube by rotating the IMUduino</dd>
